## CS 262 Project - Knight Bites

### Vision Statement

Knight Bites serves Calvin University students who, after the pandemic, wish to create meaningful connections with other Calvin University students and become more comfortable with the Grand Rapids community. It is a meet-up app that connects students through shared meals at restaurants that Calvin University is affiliated with, and, unlike tinder or other apps geared towards meet-ups, allows students to purchase these meals at a discounted price.
