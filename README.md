## CS 262 Project - Knight Bites

### Vision Statement
<p>
Knight Bites serves Calvin University students who, after the pandemic, wish to create meaningful connections with other Calvin University students and become more comfortable with the Grand Rapids community. It is a meet-up app that connects students through shared meals at restaurants that Calvin University is affiliated with, and, unlike tinder or other apps geared towards meet-ups, allows students to purchase these meals at a discounted price.<br>

College can be a difficult experience for students to adapt to, and meaningful interactions can be more difficult to come by. It is our belief as the KnightBites team that meals can be an excellent way to fostering discussion and relationships between anyone. Additionally, due to the nature of meet up apps, it can engage people with the culture of Grand Rapids as they enjoy meals. As a final incentive, users will be able to save money while doing so.</p>
